# Handwritten digit classifiers for the MNIST database

Second project for FOUNDATION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE exam. (Master's degree)

Write a handwritten digit classifier for the MNIST database. These are composed of 70000 28x28 pixel gray-scale images of handwritten digits divided into 60000 training set and 10000 test set.

Train the following classifiers on the data-set:

- SVM using linear, polynomial of degree 2, and RBF kernels;
- Random Forest;
- Naive Bayes classifier where each pixel is distributed according to a Beta distribution of parameters $\alpha, \beta$: $$d(x,\alpha,\beta)=\frac{\Gamma(\alpha+\beta)}{\Gamma(\alpha)\Gamma(\beta)} x^{(\alpha-1)} (1-x)^{(\beta-1)}$$
- k-NN.

You can use scikit-learn or any other library for SVM and random forests, but you must implement the Naive Bayes and k-NN classifiers yourself.

Use 10 way cross validation to optimize the parameters for each classifier.

Provide the code, the models on the training set, and the respective performances in testing and in 10 way cross validation.

Explain the differences between the models, both in terms of classification performance, and in terms of computational requirements (timings) in training and in prediction.
